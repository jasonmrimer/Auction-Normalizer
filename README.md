## Required Libraries
- `python3`
- `sqlite3`

## Test
There are robust tests for all the parsing, importing, and constraints. These tests use an in-memory database for fast execution. All tests are in `src/test`. To run the test:

`$ cd src`

`python -m unittest discover -s test -p "*test.py"`

## Execute
Navigate to where you saved the `submission` directory then execute

`$ cd <?/submission>`
 
`$ ./runParser.sh`
